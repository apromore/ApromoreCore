APROMORE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
==================================

REQUIREMENTS
- Windows 7 or Mac OSX 10.8 to 10.11

Ensure the following software is installed:
- Java "Server JRE" or "JDK" Edition 1.8 (available at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
- Maven 3.3.9
- Ant 1.9.2
- Git 2.3.5

Additional software required for PQL support:
- MySQL 5.6.x (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)
- LoLA 2.0 (http://service-technology.org/lola/)


* Check out the Apromore source tree using git: 'git clone https://github.com/apromore/ApromoreCode.git'
* Change to the root of the project you checked out of git.  'cd ApromoreCore'
* Run the maven command 'mvn clean install'.  This will build the Apromore manager, portal and editor and all the extra plugins.
* Create an empty H2 database 'ant create-h2'.  Only do this once, unless you just want to reset to a blank database later on.
* Run the ant command 'ant start-virgo'.  This will install, configure and start Eclipse Virgo, and deploy Apromore.
* Apromore runs on all modern browsers.  Browse http://localhost:9000
* Ctrl-C on the command line will shut the server down.


CONFIGURATION
=============

Almost all configuration occurs in the top level site.properties file.  The default version of this file from a fresh git
checkout contains reasonable defaults that use H2 as the main database, but disable PQL (which requires MySQL or Postgres and
more intricate configuration).

H2 running from a flat file is the default database for the sake of zero-configuration.
However our development is done chiefly on MySQL; instructions for reconfiguring Apromore to use MySQL appear below.
We do have plugins for Postgres and Oracle, but some extra setup will be required since we only have sql scripts to create the
database for H2 and MySQL.

Some of Apromore's features are implemented as Java applets running client-side in the browser.  If you possess an code-signing
certificate (not an SSL certificate), you can edit the top-level codesigning.properties file to use your certificate rather
than the self-signed certificate included in the source tree.  This will avoid browser warnings.


DATABASE SETUP (MySQL)
======================

Ensure MySQL is configured to accept local TCP connections on port 3306 in its .cnf file; "skip-networking" should not be present.

Start MySQL
$ sudo mysqld_safe

Set the root password of MySQL to the default used by Apromore
$ mysqladmin -u root password MAcri

Create a database named 'apromore' in your MySQL server
$ mysqladmin --user=root --password=MAcri create apromore

Create a user named 'apromore' with the required permissions
$ mysql --user=root --password=MAcri
	CREATE USER 'apromore'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'MAcri';
	GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, LOCK TABLES, EXECUTE, SHOW VIEW ON apromore.* TO 'apromore'@'localhost';

Create and populate the database tables.
$ mysql --user=root --password=MAcri < Supplements/database/db-mysql.sql

At the end of the db-mysql.sql script is where we populate some of the system data including user information.  Currently, we have a few users setup that are developers or affiliates and they can be used or you can choose to add your own.  All passwords are encrypted but they are 'password' for the time being and we don't have a facility just yet to allow a user to change their password.  This is coming soon as well as a setup utility to allow the creation of a user on first running.

Edit the top-level site.properties file, replacing the H2 declarations in "Database and JPA" with the commented-out MySQL properties.
Stop and restart the server so that it picks up the changes to site.properties.


PROCESS DISCOVERY ADVANCED SETUP (OPTIONAL)
===========================================

The "Discover BPMN model" tool has an advanced option to "Annotate for BIMP Simulation".  When this is selected, the process discoverer will include information within the created BPMN model which preconfigures it for subsequent use by the "Simulate with BIMP" tool.  This feature requires external Python scripts to be installed.

Check out the required Python scripts:
$ git clone https://github.com/AdaptiveBProcess/SiMo-Discoverer.git

See README.md in the SiMo-Discoverer checkout.  You will need Python 3.6 installed, and the following Python libraries:

lxml==4.2.5
matplotlib==2.2.3
networkx==2.2
numpy==1.15.4
seaborn==0.9.0

If you place the preceding 5 lines into a file named requirement.txt, you can install the libraries with the following command:
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Copy Supplements/apromore-simo.py from the Apromore checkout into simo/apromore-simo.py in the SiMo checkout.
In Apromore's site.properties, set the property simo.backend to the full path of the simo/apromore-simo.py script you just copied.
In Apromore's site.properties, set the property simo.python to your Python 3 executable.

Optionally, remove or comment out the @Ignore annotation from Apromore-Custom-Plugins/BPMNMiner-Logic/src/test/java/org/apromore/service/bpmnminer/impl/BPMNMinerServiceUnitTest.java.
If you do this, the unit test passing with 0 skipped tests confirms that all configuration is correct.
$ mvn test -pl :bpmnminer-logic


PREDICTIVE MONITORING SETUP (OPTIONAL)
======================================

Predictive monitoring requires the use of MySQL, as described in DATABASE SETUP (MySQL).
Populate the database with additional tables as follows:

$ mysql --user=root --password=MAcri < Supplements/database/Nirdizati.MySQL-1.0.sql

Predictive monitoring also requires various additional servers set up alongside the Apromore server.
The scripts and instructions for doing so can be checked out from GitHub with the following command:

$ git clone https://github.com/nirdizati/nirdizati-training-backend.git

Follow the instructions in nirdizati-training-backend/apromore/README.

In site.properties, set the following properties:
* training.python must be set to the location of a Python 3 executable
* training.backend must be directory containing nirdizati-training-backend
* training.tmpDir must be a writable directory for temporary files
* training.logFile must be a writable file path for logging

The following properties may usually by left at their default values:
* kafka.host can be left at the default localhost:9092, presuming Zookeeper and Kafka are running locally
* the various kafka.*.topic properties should already match those used in the nirdizati-training-backend scripts

Stop and restart the server so that it picks up the changes to site.properties.

Ensure that the following bundles are present in the Virgo pickup directory.
You can manually copy them there, but the easiest option is to edit pickupRepo in build.xml so that "ant start-virgo" copies them there on startup.
* Predictive-Monitor-Logic/target/predictive-monitor-logic-1.0.jar
* Predictive-Monitor-Portal-Plugin/target/predictive-monitor-portal-plugin-1.0.war
* Predictor-Training-Portal-Plugin/target/predictor-training-portal-plugin-1.0.war


PQL SETUP
=========

PQL queries over the process store are only supported on MySQL.  Create and populate the database with additional tables for PQL:
$ mysql --user=root --password=MAcri < Supplements/database/PQL.MySQL-1.2.sql

In site.properties, perform the following changes:
* Change pql.numberOfIndexerThreads to at least 1
* Change pql.numberOfQueryThreads to at least 1
* Change pql.lola.dir to the location of your LoLA 2.0 executable
* Change the various pql.mysql.* properties to match your MySQL database

In build.xml, uncomment the inclusion of the following PQL components in the "pickupRepo" fileset:
* APQL-Portal-Plugin/target/apql-portal-plugin-1.1.war
* Apromore-Assembly/PQL-Indexer-Assembly/src/main/resources/103-pql-indexer.plan
* PQL-Logic/target/pql-logic-1.1.jar
* PQL-Logic-WS/target/pql-logic-ws-1.1.war
* PQL-Portal-Plugin/target/pql-portal-plugin-1.1.jar

Also, uncomment the following component in the "copy-virgo" target:
* PQL-Indexer-Portal-Plugin/target/pql-indexer-portal-plugin-1.1.jar


LDAP SETUP (ADVANCED)
=====================

As distributed, Apromore maintains its own catalogue of users and passwords.
It can be modified to instead allow login based on an external LDAP directory.
This requires recompiling server components rather than just changing to site.properties; you will need to be comfortable hacking Spring, LDAP, Java and ZUL.

Edit the portal Spring configuration in Apromore-Core-Components/Apromore-Portal/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/portalContext-security.xml, uncommenting the jaasAuthenticationProvider as so:

    <!-- The remote authentication details -->
    <authentication-manager id="authenticationManager">
        <authentication-provider ref="jaasAuthenticationProvider"/>
        <authentication-provider ref="remoteAuthenticationProvider"/>
        <authentication-provider ref="rememberMeAuthenticationProvider"/>
    </authentication-manager>

    <!-- Uncommenting this bean and adding it to #authenticationManager (above) will enable LDAP logins.
         See https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.1.x/reference/jaas.html -->
    <beans:bean id="jaasAuthenticationProvider" class="org.springframework.security.authentication.jaas.JaasAuthenticationProvider">
        <beans:property name="loginConfig" value="/WEB-INF/login.conf"/>
        <beans:property name="loginContextName" value="apromore"/>
        <beans:property name="callbackHandlers">
            <beans:list>
                <beans:bean class="org.springframework.security.authentication.jaas.JaasNameCallbackHandler"/>
                <beans:bean class="org.springframework.security.authentication.jaas.JaasPasswordCallbackHandler"/>
            </beans:list>
        </beans:property>
        <beans:property name="authorityGranters">
            <beans:list>
                <beans:ref bean="authorityGranter"/>
            </beans:list>
        </beans:property>
    </beans:bean>

    <beans:bean id="authorityGranter" class="org.apromore.security.AuthorityGranterImpl">
        <beans:property name="principalClassName" value="com.sun.security.auth.UserPrincipal"/>
        <beans:property name="grants">
            <beans:set>
                <beans:value>ROLE_USER</beans:value>
            </beans:set>
        </beans:property>
    </beans:bean>

Unless you're using the University of Melbourne's central authentication, you will need to additionally edit the following files to match your local LDAP installation:
* Apromore-Core-Components/Apromore-Portal/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/login.conf
* Apromore-Core-Components/Apromore-Portal/src/main/java/org/apromore/portal/common/UserSessionManager.java (constructUserType method)

Since accounts will now be created automatically, you should also remove the "Forgot password?" and "No account yet? Register for free!" buttons on the login screen:
* Apromore-Core-Components/Apromore-Portal/src/main/webapp/login.zul

Recompile the Portal bundle and its dependencies:
$ mvn clean install -pl :apromore-portal -amd

When the server starts with the modified portal, it will automatically create new accounts for valid LDAP logins.


ACCESSING THE PORTAL
====================
* go to [apromore_domain]:9000/portal/login.zul
* use "admin”/“password” to access as administrator, or create a new account.


ACCESSING THE WEBDAV
====================
* go to [apromore_domain]:9000/filestore/login.html
* use "admin”/“password” to access as administrator, or create a new account.


SAMPLE DATA
===========

You can upload some sample data into the system with the following command:
$ ant install-sample-data

/airport contains a Configurable BPMN process models which demonstrate configurability
/pql contains Petri nets in PNML format from the PQL test suite
/repair contains a BPMN model which demonstrates log animation


COMMON PROBLEMS
===============

Out of memory while building.
* Either invoke "mvn" as "mvn -Xmx1G -XX:MaxPermSize=256m" or set the system property MAVEN_OPTS to "-Xmx1G -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"

Server fails to start.
* If either Apromore or PQL are configured to use MySQL, confirm that the database server is running.
* If you already run another server (e.g. OS X Server) may need to change the port number 8443 in Supplements/Virgo/tomcat-server.xml.

Login screen appears, but "admin" / "password" doesn't work.
* You may need to run "ant create-h2" to populate the H2 database.

Can't view models by clicking them in the summary list.
* Model diagrams are opened in new tabs/windows; you may need to disable popup blocking for Apromore in your browser settings.

Models always show up in the log as unable to be indexed.
* Check that LoLA executable is correctly configured.

Where is the server log?
* Apromore-Assembly/virgo-tomcat-server-3.6.4.RELEASE/serviceability/logs/log.log

I grabbed the PQL.MySQL-1.2.sql file directly from the PQL sources and it doesn't work!
* Edit the file and change the uuid attribute of the jbpt_petri_nodes table from VARCHAR(50) to VARCHAR(100) in two places
