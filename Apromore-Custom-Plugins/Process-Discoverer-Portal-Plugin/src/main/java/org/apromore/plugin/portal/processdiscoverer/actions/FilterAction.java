/**
 * FilterAction bundles different type of filtering requests to filter log data.
 * Each type of request is bundled as a subclass of FilterAction
 * <p>
 * To be able to do undo/redo, FilterAction keeps track of the filter criteria used by {@link}PDAnalyst
 * before and after the filter action is executed. These criteria are deep cloned from the original one.
 * <p>
 * For undo, PDAnalyst is called with pre-action filter criteria ({@link PDAnalyst#filter}).
 * <p>
 * For redo, PDAnalyst is called with either post-action filter criteria or additive criteria ({@link PDAnalyst#filterAdditive).
