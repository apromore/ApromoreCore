        CacheManager starts

        The following attributes are required for defaultCache:

        name              - Sets the name of the cache. This is used to identify the cache. It must be unique.
        maxInMemory       - Sets the maximum number of objects that will be created in memory
        eternal           - Sets whether elements are eternal. If eternal,  timeouts are ignored and the element
                            is never expired.
        timeToIdleSeconds - Sets the time to idle for an element before it expires. Is only used
                            if the element is not eternal. Idle time is now - last accessed time
        timeToLiveSeconds - Sets the time to live for an element before it expires. Is only used
                            if the element is not eternal. TTL is now - creation time
        overflowToDisk    - Sets whether elements can overflow to disk when the in-memory cache
                            has reached the maxInMemory limit.

    maxEntriesLocalHeap:
    Sets the maximum number of objects that will be created in memory.  0 = no limit.
    In practice no limit means Integer.MAX_SIZE (2147483647) unless the cache is distributed
    with a Terracotta server in which case it is limited by resources.

    maxEntriesLocalDisk:
    Sets the maximum number of objects that will be maintained in the DiskStore
    The default value is zero, meaning unlimited.

    eternal:
    Sets whether elements are eternal. If eternal,  timeouts are ignored and the
    element is never expired.

    timeToIdleSeconds:
    Sets the time to idle for an element before it expires.
    i.e. The maximum amount of time between accesses before an element expires
    Is only used if the element is not eternal.
    Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that an Element can idle for infinity.
    The default value is 0.

    timeToLiveSeconds:
    Sets the time to live for an element before it expires.
    i.e. The maximum time between creation time and when an element expires.
    Is only used if the element is not eternal.
    Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that and Element can live for infinity.
    The default value is 0.

    memoryStoreEvictionPolicy:
    Policy would be enforced upon reaching the maxEntriesLocalHeap limit. Default
    policy is Least Recently Used (specified as LRU). Other policies available -
    First In First Out (specified as FIFO) and Less Frequently Used
    (specified as LFU)
