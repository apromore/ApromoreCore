# Configuration for applet code signing.  This is used by the APQL, Cmapper and
# Quaestio components.


# The default settings below use a dummy keystore with a self-signed certificate.
# It will build and run, but applets will only work if the Java Plugin's security
# level is reduced from the default "High" to "Medium".

# dsig.keystore is relative to the Apromore-Extras/<applet project> directories.
